# Snake Game 🎮

This is a classic Snake game implementation built as a practice project to learn game logic, keyboard input handling, and basic rendering. The goal is to control the snake, eat food to grow longer, and avoid running into the walls or your own tail.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay with continuous movement.
- Food spawns at random positions on the board.
- Score increases as the snake eats food.
- Game over when the snake collides with itself or the boundary.
- Simple, readable code structure ideal for beginners to study.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/kunnaaalll/Snake-Game.git
  cd Snake-Game/SnakeGame
  ```

3. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.

4. Build and run the game depending on your language/environment:
- If it is a compiled language (like C++/Java), compile the main file (for example `SnakeGame.cpp` or `SnakeGame.java`) and run the output.
- If it is an interpreted language (like Python/JavaScript), run the main script (for example `snake.py` or `index.html` in a browser).

Adjust the command according to your actual main file name and language setup.

## Controls

- Arrow keys (↑ ↓ ← →) to move the snake.
- Optional: `P` to pause/resume, `R` to restart (if implemented in your code).

Update this section to exactly match the controls you implemented.

## Project structure

A typical layout for this project:

- `SnakeGame/`
- Source code files for the game (logic, rendering, input handling).
- Asset files (images, sounds) if used.
- Any configuration or helper modules.

Rename or expand this section to match your actual file names and folders.

## Future improvements

Some ideas to extend the game:

- Add difficulty levels (speed changes).
- Add a high-score system saved to a file.
- Add sound effects and better graphics.
- Add a main menu and restart screen.
